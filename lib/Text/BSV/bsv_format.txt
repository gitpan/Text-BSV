
Bar-Separated Values Format
===========================

Bar-Separated Values (BSV) format is a delimited-text format with
the following simple and precise rules:

 *  The character encoding must be either UTF-8 or lower-ASCII (which
    is a subset of UTF-8).

 *  A line-break sequence comprising a newline character plus an
    optional preceding carriage-return character terminates a row and
    is not part of the last field name or value in that row.  A BSV
    writer must provide a final newline character (plus an optional
    preceding carriage-return character) at the end of the last row.
    A BSV reader may respond to the lack of a final newline character
    by generating a warning but must otherwise process the last row as
    if it were properly terminated.

 *  The first row in a BSV file or data set (collection of rows) must
    contain field names (column headings).  Every record (the rows
    subsequent to the header row) must have the same number of fields,
    which must match the number of field names.

    Each field name must be unique.  Field names are case-sensitive.

    There must be at least two fields.

 *  When the vertical bar is the field delimiter, a backslash-escaped
    vertical bar (\|) represents a literal vertical bar in a field
    name or value, a backslash-escaped backslash (\\) represents a
    literal backslash, and a backslash-escaped lowercase 'n' (\n)
    represents a newline character (plus an optional preceding
    carriage-return character, depending on the system).  Any other
    occurrence of a backslash in data where the vertical bar is the
    field delimiter is an error, and a BSV reader must abort
    processing upon encountering such an error.

 *  The vertical bar (|) is the default field delimiter; however, a
    BSV reader must also correctly parse simple comma-separated,
    semicolon-separated, or tab-delimited data if the data meets the
    following criteria:

     -  The data contains no double quotation marks, no occurrences of
        the field delimiter within field names (column headings) or
        field values, and no carriage-return or newline characters
        within field names or values.

     -  The field delimiter can be unambiguously determined by
        examination of the header row and the first record.  That is,
        there must be no vertical bars in the header row (regardless
        of any backslashes), and if the header row contains multiple
        potential field delimiters (where the potential delimiters are
        the comma, the semicolon, and the horizontal tab), the
        ambiguity must be resolvable by comparing the number of field
        names that each potential field delimiter would produce in the
        first row with the number of field values that the delimiter
        would produce in the first record (which is the second row).

    When the field delimiter is not a vertical bar, a BSV reader must
    parse the data in "simple" mode, without recognizing any
    character-escape mechanisms (such as "\n").

      NOTE:  "BSV" can be said to stand for "Bar-Separated or simple
      comma-, semicolon-, or tab-separated Values".

 *  A BSV reader must not trim or "normalize" whitespace.  (Of course,
    a client application may do so after receiving the parsed data
    from the reader.)

 *  When not in "simple" mode (that is, when the field delimiter is
    the vertical bar), a BSV reader must translate backslash-escape
    sequences into the corresponding literal text when returning or
    storing a parsed BSV-format field name or value.
